# Overview

The point of this game is to defend earth from invading aliens. You use the key 'A' to move to the left and the key 'D' to move right. Spacebar will shoot bullets at the aliens. You will have a start up screen that you will have to click to start the game. The earth only has three lives and if three aliens make it to the earth then a window will appear to see if you want to play again or exit.

I wrote this to improve my programming skills. I really just need more practice and this has helped a lot in helping me figure out the details of python and the arcade library.

Watch a demonstration video here.

# Future Work

There are quite a few things I wish to still add to this game. The following is a good list of what I hope to accomplish.

* Score system
* Upgrading player: movement speed, bullet count
* Sound
* A way to have high scores
