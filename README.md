# Overview

The point of this game is to defend earth from invading aliens. You use the key 'A' to move to the left and the key 'D' to move right. Spacebar will shoot bullets at the aliens. You will have a start up screen that you will have to click to start the game. The earth only has three lives and if three aliens make it to the earth then a window will appear to see if you want to play again or exit.

I have added a leaderboard, but it is only done within the terminal and is not in the game windows. You can have up to a top ten and then if you the worst score will be deleted as better score are made.

I wrote this to improve my programming skills. I really just need more practice and this has helped a lot in helping me figure out the details of python and the arcade library.

Watch a demonstration video here.

# Relational Database

I used the SQLite that is built into python. It made it convenet for using it with my python game.

I only made one leaderboard table for this project.

# Development Environment

VS Code

Python 3.10.4
arcade library
random library
sqlite3 library

# Future Work

There are quite a few things I wish to still add to this game. The following is a good list of what I hope to accomplish.

* Score system
* Upgrading player: movement speed, bullet count
* Sound
* A way to have high scores
* Get the leaderboard connected with the arcade game windows.
